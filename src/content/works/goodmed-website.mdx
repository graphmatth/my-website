    <h3>Prismic CMS</h3>
    <p>
      We used Prismic slices, which are modular content components that allow developers and content creators to build dynamic, customizable pages with ease.
      Each slice acts as a flexible building block that can be reused and rearranged without requiring additional coding. This modularity gives non-technical teams the ability to update content layouts quickly while still maintaining design consistency.
      The main advantage of using slices is that they offer great flexibility, enabling teams to scale and adapt content as needed.

    <h3>Accesibility and visual enhancements</h3>
    <p>I used tools and CSS techniques like Radix UI and clip-path to improve the website’s accessibility, making it more user-friendly and aligned with the initial design.</p>
