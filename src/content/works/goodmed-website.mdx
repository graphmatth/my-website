    <h3>Prismic CMS</h3>
    <p>
      We use Prismic slices who are modular content components that allow developers and content creators to build dynamic, customizable pages with ease. Each slice acts as a flexible building block, which can be reused and rearranged without requiring additional coding. This modularity gives non-technical teams the ability to update content layouts quickly, while still maintaining design consistency. The main advantage of using slices is that they offer great flexibility, enabling teams to scale and adapt content as needed.
